# Feature_Engineering_and_Classification_Algorithms_with_Biological_Data
Showcasing advanced data science skills: from meticulous data cleaning and feature engineering to applying sophisticated classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM) on the Palmer Penguins dataset for species prediction.

# Overview
This repository showcases a sophisticated machine learning project aimed at classifying penguin species from the Palmer Penguins dataset. Highlighting key skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection, the project provides a deep dive into various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). It demonstrates proficiency in Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for effective data manipulation, visualization, and model training.

# Highlights
- Expert data preprocessing to prepare datasets for machine learning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
- Application of multiple classifiers, including Logistic Regression for baseline comparison, Decision Trees for interpretability, and SVM for maximizing margin separation.
- Model evaluation techniques like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess performance.
